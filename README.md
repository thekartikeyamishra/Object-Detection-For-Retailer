# Retail Object Detection (Basic Version)

## Overview

The **Retail Object Detection** tool uses pre-trained object detection models like YOLOv5 or SSD to identify and locate common objects in retail settings. This project is designed to assist businesses with inventory monitoring and shelf management.

---

## Features

1. **Object Detection**:
   - Detects products and objects in retail images using pre-trained YOLOv5 or SSD models.
2. **Image Input Options**:
   - Upload retail images for analysis.
3. **Visualization**:
   - Displays detection results with bounding boxes and labels.
4. **Simple GUI**:
   - Built with Tkinter for ease of use.

---

## Installation

### **Prerequisites**

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- CUDA (if using GPU for faster inference)

---

### **Step-by-Step Instructions**

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/thekartikeyamishra/Object-Detection-For-Retailer.git
   cd RetailObjectDetection
   ```

2. **Set Up Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download Pre-Trained Model**:
   - Download the YOLOv5 model from the [official repository](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5).
   - Save it in the `data/models/` directory.

5. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

---

## How to Use

1. Launch the application by running `main.py`.
2. Use the **Upload Image** button to load a retail image.
3. Click **Detect Objects** to analyze the image.
4. View the detection results, including bounding boxes and labels.

---

## Example Output

1. **Input Image**:
   - Retail shelf with various products.

2. **Detection Result**:
   - Objects detected with bounding boxes and labels like "bottle," "can," "box."

---

## Dependencies

The project uses the following libraries:
- `torch`: For loading and running pre-trained YOLO/SSD models.
- `opencv-python`: For image processing.
- `Pillow`: For handling image uploads.
- `matplotlib`: For visualizing detection results.
- `tkinter`: For building the graphical interface.

Install all dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **Key Notes**

- **Basic Version**:
  - Uses pre-trained models (no training required).
  - Lightweight and suitable for quick object detection tasks.

Let me know if you’d like help implementing this or need the code for the advanced version!
